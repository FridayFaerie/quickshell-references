This is meant as references for quickshell

WARNING: they could quite easily run random commands on your computer :) I don't think any of these do, but who knows, use at your own risk
(for example, end's likes to create a homework folder in your ~/Pictures)

to use, do `git submodule init`, or you can do `git submodule init src/<name>` 

after that, do `git submodule update --depth 1`

finally, you can just `qs -p <name>` from the root folder to run their quickshell things


some might need you to install dependencies, like Material Symbols font or something



Things I wanted to add, but...:

- https://github.com/qxb3/conf/tree/bing-chilling-knight - I've no clue how to do branches in submodules :(
- https://git.drinkmymilk.org/PapaMilky/Quickshell/ - can't connect to the site reliably :(
- https://github.com/Xanazf/quickshell_config - crashes :(
- https://github.com/flickowoa/zephyr - such a large repo.. :(
- https://github.com/Delamox/Hellshell - doesn't work; missing a Tray.qml (forgot to git add?) :(
- https://github.com/SirEthanator/Quickshell-WIP - no longer provides default config.json, doesn't show anything by default :(
